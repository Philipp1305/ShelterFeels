    In an empty room sits a empty person, quietly. They feel a messy something, but know not what it is or how to
    express it. Pinpointing and understanding emotions are skills and important ones at that, yet they are skills seldom
    taught. Shelterfeels
    is an attempt allow people to develop these skills for themselves in a playful manner. To do so, we use the close
    connection between speech and emotion.

    Speech is a tool of expression. It allows us to categorize, it allows us to comprehend. By expressing and naming
    emotions, we can
    improve our understanding of them; with regular practice we might even significantly improve our relation to our own
    emotions.

    As such, Shelterfeels takes the form of an intimate little box, like a jewelry box or a small treasure chest. Inside
    you will find
    a hoist of tokens for different emotions, as well as a screen and a speaker. You talk to the box. You tell it about
    your day and it will
    present back to you just that: Assorted words which <em>you</em> used to describe your day. Then, you need to be
    mindful. Think about
    what you really feel, pick a corresponding emotion token for each word and present it. Now the box knows how you
    feel and it will store
    that information. On the lid corresponding LEDs will light up, revealing how felt over the course of
    the last week, again allowing for reflection. This simple process will allow you to learn and grow.
