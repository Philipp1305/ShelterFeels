Abstract:
In an empty room sits an empty person, quietly. They feel a messy something, but know not what it is or how to
express it. Pinpointing and understanding emotions are skills, and important ones at that, yet they are skills
seldom taught. ShelterFeels is an attempt to allow people to develop these skills for themselves in a playful
manner. To do so, we use the close connection between speech and emotion.

Speech is a tool of expression. It allows us to categorize, it allows us to comprehend. By expressing and naming
emotions, we can improve our understanding of them; with regular practice, we might even significantly improve our
relation to our own emotions.

With that in mind, ShelterFeels takes the form of an intimate little box, like a jewelry box or a small treasure
chest. Inside you will find a hoist of tokens for different emotions, as well as a screen and a speaker. You talk to
the box. You tell it about your day, and it will present back to you just that: assorted words which you yourself used to
describe your day. Now you need to be mindful. Think about what you really feel, pick a corresponding emotion token
for each word, present it. As you do, the box reads out the tokens, studying how you feel, and it will store that
information. Corresponding LEDs will light up on the lid, revealing how you felt over the course of the last week,
again allowing for reflection. This simple process will allow you to learn and grow.
